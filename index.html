    Design and implement a financial management system that
    provides the following functionalities:

    1. Financial Journal: Users should be able to record transactions
    between accounts, specifying the transaction date, account names,
    entry types (debit or credit), and amounts. The system should
    maintain a ledger to keep track of account balances and generate a
    financial journal and ledger report in text format.

    2. Minimum Cash Flow: Implement a function to compute the
    minimum number of transactions required to settle debts among a
    group of people. Given a matrix representing the debts between
    individuals, the system should determine the optimal transactions
    to minimize the total cash flow.

    3. Stock Price Profit Calculation: Implement a function to calculate
    the maximum profit that can be made by buying and selling stocks
    on different days within a given period. The function should take an
    array of stock prices as input and return the buy and sell days for
    maximum profit
